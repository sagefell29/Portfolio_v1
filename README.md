# Portfolio 1.0

This is the first Portfolio I made, its hosted [here](https://www.rishikaushal.in).

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

- I drew inspiration for this portfolio website from minimalist design principles.
- The goal was to showcase the power of React's modular architecture while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface.
- To achieve this, I leveraged Chakra UI for its rapid development capabilities and a wealth of pre-built, easy-to-use components. The design elements were inspired by a variety of sources, including Microsoft's welcome screen, Mac OS's dock as a navbar, and even the elegant frosted glass effect borrowed from another talented portfolio.

## 🏗️ System Architecture and Design

- The architecture of this portfolio website is intentionally designed for a seamless user experience. It features a single-page structure to eliminate component reloads and ensure a cohesive design throughout the site.
- One notable feature is the integration of both light and dark modes, offering users a choice in their viewing experience. The modular architecture guided the development process, with different components meticulously crafted and only a single component visible at a given time.
- The only exceptions are the modeSwitcher button and the floating Navbar, which were thoughtfully designed to always be visible.
- By reusing components like buttons where appropriate, we ensured a consistent and efficient development process.

## 🚀 Development Process

The journey to create this portfolio website began with the swift creation of a basic structure, but the design of the original home section presented its challenges, leading to multiple iterations. Substantial effort was dedicated to fine-tuning the CSS to achieve the captivating frosted glass effect and harmonize the various components, guaranteeing Design Unity across the site. As requirements evolved, the education section was introduced, further enriching the content and user experience.

## 🌟 Tech Stack

- **React:** The foundation of this project, React's modular architecture empowered the creation of a dynamic and responsive website.
- **Chakra UI:** Chakra UI played a pivotal role in expediting development, offering a rich library of pre-built components and styles.

## 🛠️ Further Development

The journey doesn't end here! Future developments for this portfolio website include the addition of a skills section, allowing me to showcase my expertise. Additionally, there are plans to implement a small Node.js and Express server to store messages sent through the website, enhancing interactivity and engagement.
